# Quake-Movement-in-Godot-4
This is an experimental FPS controller ported from WiggleWizard's Quake Movement script for (Unity) into Godot 4 Beta. The player rotation node is separate (not a child of) the CharacterBody3D, that way you won't have any jittering camera movement because the camera is smoothly interlopated (Thanks Garbaj tutorials).

Please note that this controller is my first released script so it is NOT a fully fledged FPS Controller.

I recommend using this script as a basis and improving it further.

Instructions:

Extract all the files to your project folder, drag Player.tscn into your main scene.
Make sure the set your inputs such as "shoot" as Mouse0 and (WASD keys) accordingly to ui keys (ui_left, ui_right, ui_up, ui_down) as followed in the editor.
